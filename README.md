Why make a game where your character's defining characteristic is weakness? As the except put it, to put your player into someone elses shoes, to make them experience empathy. A further question, why play a game where the character's defining characteristic is weakness: to understand what it's like to be them. 
Video games are not always meant to be fun, despite the fact that they are games. Like, I would never call The Last of Us, a tragic zombie apocolypse game, fun. It's sad to grow connected to these characters you relate to so much, only to have them die a terrible death at the hands of the antagonist. It makes you think about loss and sacrifice in a way most other medias can't. With certain video games like Until Dawn, your choices directly impact and change how the story will end. Your choices as the omnipitent god controlling these characters decides if they live or die. Movies and music don't make a person think about loss that way, especially when it's your fault. 
Other forms of media are not always fun and happy. Most if not all media have examples that make the viewer think about death and loss, not never in the interactive and god-like way video games do.
